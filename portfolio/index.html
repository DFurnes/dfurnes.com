			<p class="date">August 2011</p>
			
			<p>As a design intern for the One Planet Education Network, I created a landing page for customers interested in purchasing their first educational game. The signup form includes client-side verification of input, and automatically selects the customer's credit card type based on the typed number. It also uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">Luhn's Algorithm</a> to help prevent typos when entering credit card numbers.</p>
